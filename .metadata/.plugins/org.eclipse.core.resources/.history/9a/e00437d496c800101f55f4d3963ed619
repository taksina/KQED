    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for your support of WGBH.  Our investigative news, richly set dramas, 
indispensable children’s programming, uninterrupted classical music, and standard-setting forays into our natural world depend on the support of members like you.

As requested, we have marked your account for no exchange of information.  This is a permanent change and your information will never be included in exchanges with other organizations. The privacy and security of our members is a top priority, and we respect your membership preferences.

I hope that this information is helpful.  It’s a highly competitive world out there for philanthropic support; our goal is to earn your trust and support every day.  Thank you for your contribution and please contact us with any questions, concerns, or feedback.

Sincerely,
